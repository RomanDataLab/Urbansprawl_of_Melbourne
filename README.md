Urban sensing project in Python </br>
tools: Jupyter Notebook, R, Python, Pandas +  Geopandas +  Numpy +  Folium + BeautifulSoup + OSMNX + Matplotlib + Plotly + Networkx + Scikit-learn, QGIS.
## Questions
- How official status of built heritage affects real estate prices?
- How correlation could be identified geographically?
- What is the difference between correlations of oficially listed built heritage or old buildings over 50 years with real estate prices?
## What I learned: 
- Data mining and aggregaion from Australian national, state and local resources
- Modelling of dynamic maps in QGIS and Grasshopper
- Data manipulation, cleaning and preparation for analysis
- Data visualization
- Map generation and processing with Python, R, QGIS

## Key takeaways
- Density correlates with the flats (apartments) market while homes construction booms on the remote perimeter of the metropolitan area.
- The most actively population grows in North,West and South East remote localities fueled by low-rise development.
- 400-m catchment area of public transport has gaps in the localities with fast growing population.
- Infill development would be reasonable within the inner perimeter of metropolitan area on the edge of well developed area of public transport.
